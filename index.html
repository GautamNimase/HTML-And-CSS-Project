                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p><b>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>, born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was a renowned Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of India (2002â€“2007). Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his significant contributions to India's missile and nuclear programs, he worked with DRDO and ISRO and played a key role in the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests. Despite his scientific background, he was widely loved as the "People's President" and remained deeply connected with students and youth throughout his life. He authored inspirational books like Wings of Fire and Ignited Minds. Dr. Kalam passed away on 27 July 2015 while delivering a lecture, leaving behind a legacy of dedication, simplicity, and a vision for a strong, developed India.
